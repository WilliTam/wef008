Conversation 1:

- What is the rule?
    I copied the code, and then use two matrix to store how A runs and how B runs respectively. and then combine. I first delete the boxes with the colors not concerning in this count....... (brabrabra)
- Not really what I am asking. We don't go into mechanism at this stage. So what is the rule?
    The boxes of each color will iterate according to the survival and reproduction rule. While one color is iterating, we treat boxes of other colors "0".
    If more than one color will spawn in the same box, candidate 1 will occupy.
